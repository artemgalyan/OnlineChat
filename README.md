# OnlineChat
A simple online chat.  

Current functionality is:
1) Login page (it's not logging, just select your username)
2) Chat selection page, where you can create chats or join existing ones
3) Chat page, where you can chat with other people.

You can just input your username, there are checks whether it's empty.
